# Assignment-1
# README: Insertion Sort in Monotonically Decreasing Order
#Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in Python, modified to arrange elements in a monotonically decreasing order. The assignment also emphasizes foundational software development practices, including environment setup, use of an integrated development environment (IDE), and version control with GitHub. Together, these components provide hands-on experience with both algorithmic problem-solving and professional development workflows.

# Objectives

The primary objectives of this assignment are to:

Install and verify a functional Python development environment

Configure Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Python programming

Apply GitHub for version control and project tracking

Implement and test the Insertion Sort algorithm in descending order

Practice structured coding, documentation, and incremental commits

# Tools and Technologies

Python: Core programming language used to implement the algorithm

Visual Studio Code: IDE for writing, running, and debugging Python code

GitHub: Platform for version control, repository hosting, and commit tracking

#Algorithm Description

Insertion Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time. While it traditionally sorts data in ascending order, this implementation modifies the comparison logic to achieve descending order. During execution, each element is compared with those to its left, and smaller elements are shifted right to make room for larger values. This approach reinforces understanding of loops, conditionals, and in-place list manipulation.

# Program Execution

The script includes a main execution block that defines a sample array, displays its original state, applies the sorting function, and then prints the sorted result. This structure allows the file to be run directly and makes the program easy to test with different datasets.

# Version Control Practices

GitHub was used throughout development to manage changes and document progress. Multiple commits capture key stages of the project, including initial setup, algorithm modification for descending order, and final testing. Clear commit messages ensure transparency and traceability.

# Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, the developer gained practical experience in Python programming, algorithm adaptation, and professional version control practices. The assignment strengthened understanding of how small logical changes affect algorithm behavior and highlighted the importance of structured development workflows in software engineering.
